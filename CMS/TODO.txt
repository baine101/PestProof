I'd get a list of everything on the CMS what needs to be done and work out a time estimate for them,
 then I'd  work out whats left to do for the design create estimates and then have a rough idea of whats left to be done.
Do all the CMS stuff then the Designs,
 leave yourself a week period to test,
give the url to a few people and get them to use it to see if it all works,
 if it does deliver it to him,
 if it doesnt you have a week to fix the problems
